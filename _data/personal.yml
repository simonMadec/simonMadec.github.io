intro:
  title: Welcome to Simon Madec website
  body: >

    Simon Madec is working on the use of convolutional neural networks and remote sensing technologies in crop environment. He is particularly interested in their use for plant phenotyping and crop adaptation. After an engineer diploma in computer vision (Grenoble INP, Phelma, SICOM), he received a PHD at INRA in 2019 under the supervision of Fred Baret. He was involved in many projects with the aim to deliver high-throughput methodologies for wheat phenotyping. He has been working actively to introduce the use of deep learning within the CAPTE team. Today, Simon is involved in the construction of large-scale datasets to enable reliable and robust extraction of relevant plant features using deep learning.
