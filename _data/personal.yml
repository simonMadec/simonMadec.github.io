intro:
  title: Welcome to Simon Madec website
  body: >

    The aim of my research is (i) to understand how various signals that carry information are interacting and being conveyed and integrated at the plant level and (ii) to amplify discrete physiological knowledge into functional plant processes. All of that using Functional Structural Plant Models. 


    I also develop image analysis and phenotyping tools to help researchers in their scientific workflow. I am an Open Science enthousiat, diversity advocate and coffee drinker. 


    I am currently an Assistant Professor between the [Forschungszentrum Juelich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ibg/ibg-3/EN/Home/home_node.html) and the [UCLouvain](http://www.uclouvain.be/eli) since September 2016. More about [my group here](http://www.plantmodelling.xyz). An overview of my research vision can be found [in this presentation](http://bit.ly/lobet-ucl-fzj-2).
