If you want to take a picture or scan a root system, one of the requirements is that this root system is clean of soil. While this is not an issue if the plant is grown in aeroponic or hydroponics, it is important for field- / pot-grown plants.The easiest way to clean roots is to simply let them soak in water, eventually with soap for several minutes. Then take them out and use pressurised water to remove the mud.If you need to clean smaller root or finer particles, you can use a brush to gently remove them from the roots.
